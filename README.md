# autoGrader

To setup with Phpstorm:

  - Open phpstorm
  - Select something like 'checkout from version control' and pick Git/Github
  - The Git repository URL is "https://github.com/chanceCyphers/autoGrader.git"
  - Parent directory is wherever you keep your phpstorm projects
  - Directory name is where your new project will be saved under the parent directory

This should be all it takes to get synced up with the repository on github. Commit/push/pull/fetch/etc. and how we are going to use the version control is another question.
